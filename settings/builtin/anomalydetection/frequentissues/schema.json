A problem is automatically converted into a frequent issue if the problem is detected multiple times throughout a day and over a weeks period of time and if it is not getting worse. Once it's classified as a frequent issue alerting is automatically disabled. In case that the frequent issue is getting worse problem alerts are again sent out. Within this page you can disable the frequent issue detection for all topological levels.  \nSee our [help documentation](https://dt-url.net/ex4v0pcw) about frequent issue detection.",
