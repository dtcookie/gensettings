	"displayName": "Process instance snapshots",
	"documentation": "\n\nReported process metrics:\n- CPU usage (%)\n- Memory usage (B)\n- Incoming network traffic (KB)\n- Outgoing network traffic (KB)\n\nMetrics are reported once per minute and cover the number of processes defined in **Reported processes limit**.\n\nEach host can report up to 60 minutes of these metrics per day. When the limit is exceeded, metrics aren't sent even when a new event arises.\n\nEvents triggering **Process instance snapshots**:\n- High host CPU usage\n- High host memory usage\n- High packet drop rates\n- High NIC utilization rates\n- High number of NIC errors\n- Manual requests\n- Process availability events\n\nFor details, see [Process instance snapshots](https://dt-url.net/yw02uea)",
