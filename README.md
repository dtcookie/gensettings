# gensettings

This projects acts both as a generator and a repository for Golang Structs to be used for Settings 2.0 Configurations of Dynatrace.
Purpose is to automate as much as possible when creating additional resources for the Dynatrace Terraform Provider.

Generated structs can be found within the `settings` folder. In case of adding improvements to the generator, please always run it once and check in the most recent generated code alongside with these modifications.
